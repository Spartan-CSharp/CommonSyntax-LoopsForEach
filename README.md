# CommonSyntax-LoopsForEach
The homework from the Lesson 11, Loops: foreach, of Module 2, Common Syntax, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to ask the user for their first name. Continue asking for first names until there are no more. Then loop through each name using foreach and tell them hello.
